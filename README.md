Hi, I'm Niko. 

At the moment I'm focused on improving my Haskell skills (these days I mainly code in Python, Scala or Javascript, but still remember bits from a tail of languages I used to use in the past, e.g. *.Net, C++, Elixir, etc). At times I try to get involved in Open Source projects to sharpen my skills.

My true passion is in Computer Vision (Deep Learning) but unfortunately I rarely do anything in that space at the moment.
