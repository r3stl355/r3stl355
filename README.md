Hi, I'm Niko. 

Currently I'm learning Rust and Scala 3 (these days I mainly code in Python, Scala or Javascript, but still remember bits from a tail of languages I used to use in the past, like bunch of .Net languages, C++, Haskell, etc). At times I get involved in some Open Source projects to sharpen my skills in the areas I'm interested in (e.g. [MLFlow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow), [Delta Sharing](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-sharing), [MXNet](https://github.com/apache/mxnet), etc).

My true passion is Computer Vision (Deep Learning) and Robotics, but I am not doing anything in that space at the moment.
