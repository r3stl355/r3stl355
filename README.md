Hi, I'm Niko. 

I am a developer and an architect, and these two skills happily co-exist in me.

Currently I'm focusing on Rust and a bit of Scala 3, but at work I mainly code in Python, Scala, SQL and Javascript. I still remember bits from a tail of languages I used in the past, like .Net languages, C++, Haskell, etc. 

At times I get involved in some Open Source projects to sharpen my skills in the areas I'm interested in (e.g. [Delta Rust](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs), [MLFlow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow), [Delta Sharing](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-sharing), [MXNet](https://github.com/apache/mxnet), etc).

My true passion is Robotics, but I am not doing anything in that space at the moment.
