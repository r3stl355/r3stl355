Hi, I'm Niko. 

Currently I'm learning Rust (these days I mainly code in Python, Scala or Javascript, but still remember bits from a tail of languages I used to use in the past, like bunch of .Net languages, C++, Haskell, etc). At times I get involved in some Open Source projects to sharpen my skills in the areas I'm interested in (at the moment it's MLFlow [https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow]).

My true passion is Computer Vision (Deep Learning) and Robotics but I am not doing anything in that space at the moment.
