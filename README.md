Hi, I'm Nikolay. 

I'm trying to ramp up my C++ (other languages I currently code in are Python, Scala and Javascript, followed by a tail of other languages I used in the past but don't really use these days). Time to time I try to get involved in Open Source projects to sharpen my skills.

My true passion is in Computer Vision (Deep Learning) but in reality, I rarely do anything in that space at the moment.
