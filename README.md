Hi, I'm Niko. 

At the moment I'm focused on improving my Haskell skills (these days I mainly code in Python, Scala or Javascript, but still remember bits from a tail of languages I used to use in the past, like bunch of .Net languages, C++, Elixir, etc). At times I get involved in Open Source projects to sharpen my skills in areas I'm interested in (looking at the MLFlow [https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow] at the moment).

My true passion is Computer Vision (Deep Learning) and Robotics but at the moment I'm not involved in anything in that space.
